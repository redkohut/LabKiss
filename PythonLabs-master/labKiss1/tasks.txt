Lab 1: Intro to Python
Task 1
Write a Python-script that performs simple arithmetic operations: '+', '-', '*', '/'. The type of operator and
data are set on the command line when the script is run.
The script should be launched like this:
>>python my_task.py 1 * 2

Task 2
Write a Python-script that performs the standard math functions on the data.
The name of function and data are set on the command line when the script is run.
The script should be launched like this:
>>python my_task.py add 1 2

Task 3
Write a Python-script that determines whether the input string is the correct entry for the 'formula' according EBNF syntax (without
using regular expressions).

Formula = Number | (Formula Sign Formula)
Sign = '+' | '-'
Number = '0' | '1' | '2' | '3' | '4' | '5' | '6' | '7' | '8' | '9'
Input: string
Result: (True / False, The result value / None)
Example,
user_input = '1+2+4-2+5-1' result = (True, 9)
user_input = '123' result = (True, 123)
user_input = 'hello+12' result = (False, None)
user_input = '2++12--3' result = (False, None)
user_input = '' result = (False, None)

Task 4
You are given n bars of gold with weights: w1, w2, ..., wn and bag with capacity W.
There is only one instance of each bar and for each bar you can either take it or not (hence you cannot take a fraction of a bar).
Write a function that returns the maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack's capacity.
The first parameter contains 'capacity' - integer describing the capacity of a knapsack.
The next parameter contains 'weights' - list of weights of each gold bar.
Output : Maximum weight of gold that fits into a knapsack with capacity of W.
