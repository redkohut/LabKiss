Lab #4. Part 2 (deadline - 16/12/2021)
A software academy teaches two types of courses: local courses that are held
in some of the academy’s local labs and offsite courses held in some other
town outside of the academy’s headquarters. Each course has a name, a teacher
assigned to teach it and a course program (sequence of topics). Each teacher
has a name and knows the courses he or she teaches. Both courses and teachers
could be printed in human-readable text form. All your courses should
implement ICourse. Teachers should implement ITeacher. Local and offsite
courses should implement ILocalCourse and IOffsiteCourse respectively.
Courses and teachers should be created only through the ICourseFactory
interface implemented by a class named CourseFactory. Write a program
that will form courses of software academy.
